ABOUT ADRIAN-PETRU BLEOJU
──────────────────────────
Adrian-Petru Bleoju is a Computer Science graduate from UAIC Iași, Romania.
He is a thoughtful and detail-oriented software developer, with a particular passion for
frontend and mobile development, clean UI design, and elegant user experiences.
He combines a strong technical foundation with a creative, design-minded approach to coding.

Adrian is calm, analytical, and curious by nature. He prefers simplicity over excess,
and strives to write code that feels organized, predictable, and visually balanced.
He is also reflective and perfectionist at times — often polishing details until they feel “just right”.

He’s currently expanding his experience into AI and data engineering, exploring technologies such as
Python, Pandas, dbt, and Airflow, while maintaining a strong focus on frontend frameworks
like Next.js, Tailwind, and Flutter.

WORK & ACADEMIC BACKGROUND
──────────────────────────
Adrian studied Computer Science at UAIC (Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași),
where he completed several academic projects covering algorithms, databases, and software design.
His Bachelor’s thesis, *Forking Food*, is a mobile Flutter app that recommends recipes based on user
preferences and swipe interactions (like a Tinder for food). It integrates Firebase, real-time data sync,
and personalized recommendation logic.

He also built multiple university projects such as:
• *ReT – Resource Recommender Tool*: a Node.js + MySQL web app using an MVC structure, with user auth and RSS aggregation.
• *TicTacToe*: a Flutter app with AI opponent logic (three difficulty levels).
• *Backgammon* and *Battleships*: classic games written in Java and Python (CLI-based).
• *Pheasant Game*: a C client–server game using sockets for network communication.

Professionally, Adrian collaborated with Creative Tim, where he developed dashboards and UI components
using HTML, Tailwind, Bootstrap 5, and modern JavaScript. His work focused on reusable design systems,
layout structure, and front-end scalability for premium templates such as:
• Corporate UI Dashboard (Pro and Free versions)
• Argon Dashboard (Pro and Tailwind versions)
• Soft UI Dashboard (Pro and Tailwind versions)
• Loopple Components for Low-Code Builder

PERSONALITY & INTERESTS
──────────────────────────
Adrian is reliable, kind, and respectful. He tends to be reserved in groups,
but shines through thoughtful work and calm decision-making.
He’s motivated by the idea of improving ideas rather than replacing them —
preferring subtle refinements that make software feel more human.

Outside coding, Adrian enjoys photography, cars (especially BMW engineering and design),
good food and cooking, and exploring tech through experimentation.
He’s also drawn to minimalistic visual styles and good product storytelling.
